def build_causal_graph(self) -> np.ndarray:
    # Learn temperature â†’ humidity â†’ air_quality causality
    # Detect traffic â†’ noise â†’ air_quality chains
    # Identify structural vibration â†’ safety relationships
```

    threshold = np.percentile(list(self.baseline_scores), self.threshold_percentile)
```

### 3. **Multi-Modal Event Fusion**
```python
# Correlate multiple sensor types for event detection
group_emergency_probs = []  # Temperature + Audio + Air Quality
for emergency in coordinated_emergencies:
    # Fire = High temp + Loud noise + Poor air quality
    confidence = weighted_sensor_fusion(temp, audio, air_quality)
```

### 4. **Edge Intelligence**
```python
# Deploy on resource-constrained devices
quantized_model = self.quantize_model(model)
edge_partitions = self.partition_graph_computation(pruned_model)
```
